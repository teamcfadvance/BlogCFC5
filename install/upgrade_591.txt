This document explains what is required to update to BlogCFC 5.9.1.

First, two new columns were added to the comments table. You can run the script below, or simply
add the columns described below. The script is for MySQL. 

ALTER TABLE `tblblogcomments`
	ADD COLUMN `killcomment` varchar(35) NULL
	
ALTER TABLE `tblblogcomments`
	ADD COLUMN `subscribeonly` tinyint(1) NULL
	
The killcomment column is a new UUID column. It used to allow admins to have a 'one click' delete from their emails. You don't have to logon.
You just click the link in the email and the comment is deleted. Note that I did not bother telling you to write a script to add UUIDs to old
comments. Since this feature is for emails only, and only for new comments, it doesn't really need it.

The subscribeonly column is my hackish way to support folks subscribing to comments w/o having to write a new comment. This flag then
hides it from the comment count and from the display. Again, you can leave the old values null. The SQL should be able to handle it.

Please copy all files over the from the zip. Or look at readme.txt for a precise list of files changed.
